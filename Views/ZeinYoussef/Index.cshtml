            I worked as an intern for Techtown Detroit in the Summer of 2018. As an intern for their DTX Launch program I came in with
            a team and a business idea. We then spent multiple weeks developing a business model around our idea using a lean business
            approach. Meaning that we spent the Summer conducting over 100 customer discovery interviews with people that we believed were
            in our target market in order to educate ourselves on the viability of our business idea.
